Learning GitHub is cool!

I have downloaded and integrated Visual Studio Code
into my toolset and linked it to my GitHub.

Installed VirtualBox Virtual Machine and installed Ubuntu operating system to better protect my hardware as I learn and enhance my learning through Ubuntu/Linux.

Added Gnome Keyring and attempted to swap the code.cpp file to Ubuntu from Windows. If I can't get it right I'll delete it and retry with a new cpp file.
